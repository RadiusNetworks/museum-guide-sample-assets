<h1>Ganesha</h1>
<h3>New Delhi, India, 2003</h3>
<h3>Wood carving</h3>

<p>One of the classic images of the Hindu pantheon, Ganesha dances atop his vehicle Moushika the rat.  His broken tusk calls back to the legend where he broke it off and threw it at the moon when it mocked him.
This traditional woodcarving is made from a single block and lightly colored to suggest a patina of age.
