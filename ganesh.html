<h1>Madonna With Child</h1>
<h3>Cuzco, Peru 2004</h3>
<h3>Oil on canvas</h3>

<p>This modern oil painting captures the essence of the classic Cuzquena school style that dominated Alta Peru during the colonial era.  The elaborate fabric of the mother's gown
mirrors the importance of fine fabrics with complex textures to the Incan people.  The gold leaf overlay and the feather plumes on the headdress echoes  the high status of the painting's subject
in a way fitting to a viewer used to seeing such embellishments on Incan leaders.
