<h1>Buddha Dragon Boat</h1>
<h3>Hue, Vietnam 2011</h3>
<h3>Carved teak</h3>

<p>A common traditional theme in Vietnam, elders depicted as stylized Buddha images ride on a whimsical boat in the shape of a dragon.  Four men sit around a game table.  Another in front guides the ship with a globe in hand.  Musicians in the rear entertain the passengers.  This fantastic
specimen is carved from a single piece of wood.  Note the birds perched on the rear of the boat, and the separate base depicted with sea creatures.
