<h1>Day of the Dead Trumpeter</h1>
<h3>Oaxaca, Mexico 2000</h3>
<h3>Burned wood</h3>

<p>This whimsical figure combines the Mexican obsession with death with the culture's joyous love of music.  Produced as an ornament to celebrate the Day of the Dead celebrations around All Saint's Day,
this life-sized figure is carved from wood that is then coated with kerosene and burned to give it a weathered look.</p>
