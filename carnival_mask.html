<h1>Carnival Mask</h1>
<h3>Chichicastenango, Guatemala, mid-20th century</h3>
<h3>Painted wood</h3>

<p>This carnival mask of a Spanish warrior would traditionally be worn by a reveler opposite another wearing a mask of a Moor.  Most
people in the area are of Mestizo or Indian ancestry giving an ironic twist to celebrating the victory of the Spanish over a different 
culture.

Note the small size of the mask, which reflects the short stature of highlands Guatemalans.  Faded remnants of paint suggest that this mask, 
acquired in 1999, dates to earlier in the
20th century.
