<h1>Hanuman Statue</h1>
<h3>Bali, Indonesia 2003</h3>
<h3>Sandstone</h3>

<p>Balinese stone carvers carry on the rich tradition of Hindu arts in what is now a predominantly Muslim nation.  Today, most stone
carvers focus their energies on export-oriented subjects like dolphins or Buddha figures, but it is in traditional themes like this Hindu
monkey god that Balinese craftsmanship really shines.  Note the rich detail including spiral eyes, textured skullcap, and jeweled
necklace.

This piece would have been one of two placed atop adjacent pedestals to form a gateway.
